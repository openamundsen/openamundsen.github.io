The project is hosted at the research team "Human-environment systems research" [Department of Geography, University of Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/geographie/mus/index.html.en).

The project is supported by the Department of Geography and the Faculty of Geo- and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of Innsbruck.
