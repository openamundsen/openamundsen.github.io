The open-source project openAMUNDSEN was born in 2020 with the first release of the model at [GitHub](https://github.com/openamundsen/openamundsen). The model builds upon a long history of snow model development dating back to 2001.

openAMUNDSEN is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/openamundsen/openamundsen/blob/main/LICENSE).

The project is curated by the research team "Human-environment systems research" [Department of Geography, University of Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/geographie/mus/index.html.en).

The project is supported by the Department of Geography and the Faculty of Geo- and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of Innsbruck.
